Summary: Using PySpark, this code read's in a very large dataset and then uses SparkSQL to answer questions about the data.  The dataset is in regards to Home Sales and our questions find average prices of homes sold depending on variables such as number of bedrooms, number of floors and square footage.  I then created temporary tables and perform queries to understand the runtime differences between cached and uncached data.
